# SheHacks2021 - Educating Girls Aged 10-15 About Finance Through Game

We create this game on the website with the goal of helping girls to better understand topics related to finance, 
for example, personal finance. We want to empower women from an early age to make smart decisions for their finances, 
and this game is particularly targeted towards girls aged 10-15, who might start earning some money in part-time jobs, 
and it's important for them to understand how to manage their money intelligently. Having this education and exposure early
on would empower them to have greater control of their personal and family finances, to break the stereotype of males often
are taking care of managing the finances in the households.

The user would get to read a few paragraphs to learn more about personal finances, then they can play the game to 
deepen their understandings.
